# React_CurrencyConverter

Hello world!! This project, is a _currency exchange converter_,it is powered by React.js and the data is fetched from the [exchangerates](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) API.

The _Styling_ was developed with plain **CSS**, and it's fairly simple. The focus of the project was the functionality of the components.

The prefix "https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com" were placed before the exchangerates API string, to avoid any *mixed content error* on this simple app, and that way proxying requests to these site via another server.
